# DRAGONS-development
This repository contains all the code and related data performing geneative design of system architectures using LLM's and the DRAGONS architecting method, also presented [in this repo](https://github.com/Ghipag/DRAGONS-development/tree/main)

## Setup
The [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) database was setup to run inside a [docker container](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/docker/), and the python package [py2neo](https://py2neo.org/2021.1/) was used as an interface between the database and python. The architecture data used tpo run experiments is stored under /data.
